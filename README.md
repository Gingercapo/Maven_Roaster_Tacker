# Maven_Roaster_Tacker

Am going to use advanced analytics and visual design to take Maven’s BI reports to the
next level!

THE SITUATION


THE BRIEF

Maven Roasters needs a way to track KPIs (sales, profit, units, returns), compare
performance across markets, analyze category profitability, and identify high-value
customers.
All you’ve been given is a folder of excel files containing information about orders, returns,
products, customers and territories. 

OBJECTIVE

Use Tableau Desktop to:
• Create relationships between data sources
• Design dynamic dashboards & visuals
• Leverage geospatial mapping features
• Apply advanced calculations to key business use cases
• Integrate predictive analytics assets
